# FindmeOut_

This project includes the learning and implementation of small theories in these assignments required for the deeper understanding of machine learning and these all projects will finally lead to a Machine Learning Project : Find Me Out.
Find Me Out is an image recognization project completed using these assignments.
This projects starts with basics of Data analysis going to supervised Machine learning and unsupervised Machine Learning and finally to the Neural Networks and its objectives with it's learnings.
